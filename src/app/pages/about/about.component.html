          Hello! I'm Jayabrata, a passionate .NET Core developer with 3+ years of experience building web applications and services. 
          My journey in software development began when I built my first website during college, and I've been hooked ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating with a mechanial Engineering degree, I joined a software consulting firm where I worked on enterprise-level applications
          using the .NET ecosystem. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects across different industries,
          from finance to healthcare to e-commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in building robust, scalable backend services with .NET Core and SQL Server, while also having strong
          experience with modern frontend frameworks like Angular. I believe in clean architecture, test-driven development,
          and writing maintainable code that solves real business problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading tech blogs, or experimenting with new technologies. I'm always eager
          to learn and grow both as a developer and a person.
        </p>
